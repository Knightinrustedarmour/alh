"""
Basic working 'electricity and heat' example.

Basic working 'electricity and heat' example which includes a location (house),
electricity wise: an electricity carrier which acts as a electricity
source/supply from the official grid (working price of 0.035 ct/Wh) as well as
a demand (consumer) with a demand time series.
And heat wise: a heat carrier, a heat pump, an heat exchanger as well as
a heat demand time series.

At first an energy system (here meta_model) is defined with a time series (index).
Afterwards a location is defined and added to the energysystem. Then the
electricity carrier and electricity demand (time series) are added to the
energysystem. Furthermore a heat carrier is defined with specific temp-
erature level(s) and a reference temperature. Then  a heat demand (time series)
is added with a certain flow and return temperature. Lastly, a heat pump with
a possible thermal power limit and heat exchanger with a certain air
temperature are added to the energy system.

Finally, the energy system is optimised/solved via meta_model.solve, a plot is
created and the solver output is written to an .lp file.
