     Class representing a hydrogen injection into Hydrogen Pipeline.

    Functionality: This models the hydrogen injection into a 100% Hydrogen Pipeline.
    The inclusion of this feature in MTRESS is based on the recognition of various
    government initiatives in several developed countries, including Germany, where
    efforts are being made to establish pipelines dedicated to transporting 100%
    hydrogen. In Germany, there are already existing/in plan pipelines that have been
    repurposed or newly constructed to transport hydrogen exclusively. This
    functionality can be enabled in MTRESS,allowing for the modeling of hydrogen
    injection into such pipelines.
